#my-tetris

Tetris-like game using SDL2 library.

##Installation

Requires SDL2 library.
On an Ubuntu machine it can be installed with:
```
sudo apt install sdl2-2.0 sdl2-dev
```
For other OS-es follow the instructions on sdl2 project page at : https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

After installing sdl2 the app can be compiled using ```cmake``` (install cmake utilities first if missing).

I recommend using the followind commands (assuming linux environment):

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```

##Running

Run the executable.
